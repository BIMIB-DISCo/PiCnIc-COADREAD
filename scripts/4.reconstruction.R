### Selection
###
### We want to restrict to considering genes accorfing to their
### frequence. We do that for a reason: we used a TCGA curated list
### which ensures that those are drive, however some of them might
### have very low frequency (in terms of marginals) and we would like
### to limit their use for a model.
###
### However, some genes might be part of a group of exclusive
### alterations, and in that case it would be biased to account for
### their frequency, regardless of the group they belong to (this is
### also supported as many new tools try detect higly unbalanced
### exclusivity groups). Thus, we implement a double criterion which
### is in the following function.

select = function(x, min.freq, forced.genes) {
    ## First, for each gene we want to have its frequency, regardless
    ## the types of alterations it harbours. So we want TP53 overall
    ## frequency by accounting for mutations and CNAs.

    ## To get that, we collapse multiple events per gene in one unique
    ## event with one of TRONCO functions.
    
    x.sel = as.alterations(x)	

    
    ## We want a list of genes which have such frequency above a
    ## threshold, which is a parameter here. This list is also
    ## containig a set of genes regardless of this frequency paramter
    ## - this special set of genes is a parameter as well. TRONCO
    ## events.selection supports both types of criteria.
    
    x.sel = events.selection(x.sel, 
                             filter.freq = min.freq, 
                             filter.in.names = forced.genes)
    
    ## Subset input - select all events for any gene in "x.sel".
    
    x = events.selection(x, filter.in.names = as.genes(x.sel))
    return(x)	
}


### We set this as a variable -- 5% minimum frequency.

MIN.FREQ = 0.05


### Selected MSS dataset. The list of genes which are forced to be
### sleected are those which are part of an exclusivity group.

### Selected MSI dataset.

MSI.H.select = select(MSI.H, 
                      MIN.FREQ, 
                      unique(c(TCGA.MEMO,

                               )

MSI.H.select = annotate.description(MSI.H.select,
                                    'TCGA COADREAD \nMSI-HIGH \ncolorectal tumors')

### Before the reconstruction we dataset can be consolidated, in the
### sense that we check for alterations which have the same signature
### across the samples. If we find them we could decide to either
### merge the events - maybe giving them a mnemonic name - or delete
### one of them.
###
### This is necessary as such alterations will be statistically
### undistinguishable. The function below checks also for alterations
### which are always/never present in the samples, but it will not
### find those for COADREAD. If the function returns empty results,
### data is ok.

### Selected MSS is ok.

cd = consolidate.data(MSS.select, T)


### In MSI we need to manipulate data instead.

cd = consolidate.data(MSI.H.select, T)


### FBXW7 amplification and PTEN mutations are discarded
MSI.H.select = delete.event(MSI.H.select,
                            gene = 'FBXW7',
                            type = 'Amplification')
MSI.H.select = delete.event(MSI.H.select,
                            gene = 'PTEN',
                            type = 'Mutation')


### We make use of a function to transform groups in CAPRI's
### hypotheses, to add hypotheses for genes with multiple types of
### alterations and to run CAPRI.

recon = function(x, folder, mutex, ...) {
    
    lift = x
	
    ## 1. create formulas from every MUTEX group

    if (!is.null(mutex)) {
        ## This is TRONCO's hypothesis adding function from
        ## groups. It is the quickest way to include a formula,
        ## but not necessarily the one you want to use, as you
        ## might want something custom, while this is pretty
        ## automatic -- and hence constrained.
	
        ## It takes a function FUN which is a connective from the
        ## language of n-ary AND/OR/XOR operators, and builds a
        ## corresponding formula. We make an example, do not
        ## consider that we set dim.min = length(w).
        
	
        ## Example: consider a group of alterations in genes KRAS,
        ## TP53, APC. Assume that in our data we  have alterations
        ## as follows: for KRAS, of both type Mutation and
        ## Deletion where no samples harbour boths, and for TP53
        ## and APC only of type Mutation. Let FUN = OR, also.

        ##    This function will create the following formula
	
        ##    OR( XOR(KRAS:Mutation, KRAS:Deletion), TP53:Mutation, APC:Mutation )
	
        ##   where XOR(KRAS:Mutation, KRAS:Deletion) is the
        ##   subformula created as KRAS has two distinct types of
        ##   hard-exclusive alterations. Such a formula could be
        ##   equivalently created with the hypothesis.add()
        ##   function, in that case one could decide to use only
        ##   one of the KRAS alterations, for instance.
	
        ## This function is creating in principle as many formulas
        ## as many are the subsets of genes it can sample from the
        ## group. We do not want that in some cases, such as now,
        ## and we control that via dim.min.
        ## When we set  the minimum group size (dim.min) parameter
        ## equal to the number of elements in the group, we get
        ## exactly that.

                                        FUN = OR,  # formula type is "soft exclusivity" (OR)
                                        group = w, # the group
                                        dim.min = length(w) # only 1 group has maximal length  
                                        ) 
        }
    }
	
    ## For the sake of correctness, we check that for groups which
    ## were not explicitely computed from a cohort, we have the actual
    ## releveant genes/alteraitons available.
    ##
    ## Now we subset Wnt groups to genes actually present in lift, and
    ## we add again the formula. Notice that formulas for groups with
    ## dimension smaller than 2 will not be created.

    ## TRONCO also allows to automatically insert subformulas as

### Work..

MSS.models = recon(x = MSS.select, folder = 'MSS', mutex = MSS.mutex)
MSI.models = recon(x = MSI.H.select, folder = 'MSI', mutex = MSI.H.mutex)


### Now the view function displays also some other information about
### the models.

view(MSS.models)
view(MSI.models)


### We show the edges in each of these models through a TRONCO
### function which puts in a table each selective advantage relation,
### and provides also the marginal frequencies of the
### upstream/downstream event. Also, p-values for the temporal
### priority, probability raising and hypergeometric testing are
### reported. Two table are returned, one for each regularizer as each
### model has its own set of edges.

as.selective.advantage.relations(MSS.models)
as.selective.advantage.relations(MSI.models)


### CAPRI has an optimization strategy which selects among all edges
### which satisfy Suppes' conditions only those which are considered
### best. If one is willing to see the full set of edges the above
### function can be used with a type parameter.

as.selective.advantage.relations(MSS.models, type = 'pf') # These
                                        # edges are called 'prima
                                        # facie' (pf).

### Notice that one can also visualize these relations in a graphical
### way. Try for instance:

### tronco.plot(MSS.models, pf = TRUE)


### This function has some options to query only a subset of the
### relations, for instance one might be interested in KRAS/PIK3CA
### ones.

### as.selective.advantage.relations(MSS.models, 
###                                  events = as.events(MSS.models,
###                                                     genes = c('KRAS', 'PIK3CA')))

### Or those involving just Wnt genes.

### as.selective.advantage.relations(MSS.models, 
###                                 events = as.events(MSS.models, genes = Wnt))
