# MUTEX is a Java tool, which is supposed to be executed outside this R    #
# environment, to detect groups of exclusive alteration; it is one of the  #
# tools mentioned in the PiCnIc manuscript and supported in TRONCO         #
# The original project is hosted at                                        #
#                                                                          #

# We executed the tool with its default parameters (and renamed the        #

# approximately 6 and 3.5 hours, so we make available the MUTEX output in  #
# advance.                                                                 #

# In PiCnIc one can accommodate prior knowledge about other groups, which       #
# might have been fetched by the literature or other tools. In the COADREAD     #
# case we can exploit the fact that Wnt alterations in APC/CTNNB1 are often     #
# exclusive, as well as KRAS/RNAS/BRAF from RAF pathway. Also, TCGA has run     #
# the same analysis using another tool, called MEMO, and found significance     #
# trends of exclusivitiy among some PI3K genes and activators of that pathway.  #
# These are ERBB2, IGF2, PIK3CA and PTEN. Note that the MEMO group described by #
# TCGA contained mutations/CNAs and IGF2 overexpression. Since we are dealing   #
# with the problem of progression inference, and here we are forced to use      #
# altered states which are persistent across tumor evelution (mutations and     #
# CNAs), we are not using as a sampl IGF2 overexpression -- but its             #
# amplification yes, as it is a CNA.                                            #
