# We load all mutations annotated by the consortium in the MAF file that they   #

#   - option is.TCGA, which checks if every patient is associated to a unique   #
#     patient -- if not, we resolve that with other TRONCO functions. Notice    #
#     that if this is the case the function will raise a warning, which is the  #
#     case for COADREAD samples.                                                #
#   - filter.fun, which is a custom function that one can define to filter out  #
#     some MAF entries that he does not want to process. The function is then   #
#     applied on each row of the MAF, via apply(), so it is supposed to return  #
#     a TRUE/FALSE flag for every . In this case, as we know that the MAF has   #
#     many more genes annotated, we just check if the annotated gene is one of  #
#     the list that we declared. An alternative option would have been to load  #
#     the full MAF and then use events.selection() function with option         #
